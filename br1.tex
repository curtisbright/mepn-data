\begin{abstract}
We say a string of symbols $s$ is {\it minimal} for a language $L$
if $s$ is a member of $L$, and it is not possible to obtain another 
member of $L$ by striking out one or more symbols from $s$.  Although
the set $M(L)$ of minimal strings is necessarily finite, determining
it explicitly for a given $L$ can be a difficult computational problem.  
We use some number-theoretic heuristics to compute $M(L)$, where $L$
is the language of base-$b$ representations of the prime numbers,
for $2 \leq b \leq 28$.

\section{Introduction}

Problems about the digits of prime numbers have a long history, and many
of them are still unsolved.  For example, are there infinitely many
primes, all of whose base-$10$ digits are $1$?  Currently,
there are only five
known, corresponding to $(10^p-1)/9$ for $p = 2, 19, 23, 317, $ and
$1031$.    It seems likely that four more are given by
$p = 49081, 86453, 109297, 270343$, but this has not yet been
rigorously proven.

Another problem on the digits of primes was introduced by the
third author \cite{Sh00}.  To describe it, we need some definitions.
We say that a string $x$ is a {\it subword} of a string $y$, and 
we write $x \subw y$, if 
one can strike out zero or more symbols of $y$ to get $x$.
For example, {\tt string} is a subword of
{\tt Meistersinger}.  
(In the literature, this concept is sometimes called a ``scattered
subword'' or ``substring''.)
A {\it language} is a set of strings.  A string $s$ is {\it minimal}
for $L$ if  (a) $s \in L$ and (b) if $x \in L$ and $x \subw s$, then
$x = s$.    The set of all minimal strings of $L$ is denoted $M(L)$.

In this paper, we describe a heuristic
technique for determining $M(L_b)$ in the
case where $L_b$ consists of the representations, in base $b$, of the
the prime numbers $\lbrace 2, 3, 5, \cdots \rbrace$.  We obtain
a complete characterization of $M(L_b)$ for bases
$2 \leq b \leq 16$.   For $17 \leq b \leq 28$, we obtain
results that allow us to ``almost'' completely characterize this set.

In what follows, if $x$ is a string of symbols over the alphabet
$\Sigma_b = \lbrace 0, 1, \ldots, b-1 \rbrace$, we let 
$[x]_b$ denote the evaluation of $x$ in base $b$ (starting with the
most significant digit); when the base is clear we may simply denote
this by $[x]$.  We let $(x)_b$ be the canonical representation
of $x$ in base-$b$, that is, the representation without leading zeroes.
The set of all canonical representations in base $b$ is denoted
$C_b$.

\section{Why minimal sets are interesting}

The minimal set $M(L)$ of a language $L$ is interesting because it
allows us to compute two natural and related languages,
defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\subb(L) &= \lbrace x \in \Sigma^* \ : \ 
	\text{ there exists } y \in L \text{ such that } x \subw y \rbrace  ;\\
\supe(L) &= \lbrace x \in \Sigma^* \ : \ 
	\text{ there exists } y \in L \text{ such that } y \subw x \rbrace .
\end{align*}

An amazing fact is that $\subb(L)$ and $\supe(L)$ are always regular.
This follows from
the following classical theorem due to Higman \cite{Hi52} and
Haines \cite{Ha69}.

\begin{theorem}
For every language $L$, there are only finitely many minimal strings.
\end{theorem}

Indeed, we have $\supe(L) = \bigcup_{x \in M(L)} \supe (\lbrace x \rbrace)$
and $\Sigma^* - \subb(L) = \supe(M(\Sigma^* - \supe(L)))$.

\section{Why the problem is hard}

Determining $M(L)$ for arbitrary $L$
is in general unsolvable, and can be difficult even for
relatively simple $L$ \cite{GHK07}.

The following is a ``semi-algorithm'' that 
is guaranteed to produce $M(L)$, but not so easy to implement:
\bigskip
\noindent (1) $ M := \emptyset$ \\
\noindent (2) while ($L \not= \emptyset$) do \\
\quad (3) choose $x$, a shortest string in $L$ \\
\quad (4) $ M := M \ \cup \ \lbrace  x \rbrace$ \\
\quad (5) $ L := L - \supe(\lbrace x \rbrace) $ \\

In practice, for arbitrary $L$,
we cannot feasibly carry out step (5).  Instead, we work
with $L'$, some regular overapproximation to $L$, until we can show $L' =
\emptyset$ (which implies $L = \emptyset$).  In practice,
$L'$ is usually chosen to be a finite union of sets of the form 
$L_1 L_2^* L_3$, where each of $L_1, L_2, L_3$ is finite.
In the case we consider in this paper,
we then have to determine whether such a language contains
a prime or not.

However, it is not even known if the following simpler decision problem is 
recursively solvable:

\medskip

\begin{problem}
Given strings $x, y, z$, and a base $b$, does there exist a prime
number whose base-$b$ expansion is of the form $x \overbrace{yy\cdots y}^n z$
for some $n \geq 0$?
\end{problem}

\medskip

An algorithm to solve this problem, for example, would allow us to decide
if there are any additional Fermat primes (of the form $2^{2^n}+1$)
other than the known ones (corresponding to $n = 0,1,2,3,4$).

Therefore, in practice, we are forced to try to rule out prime
representations based on modular techniques and factorizations.
This is discussed in the next section.

\section{Some useful lemmas}
It will be necessary for our algorithm to determine if families of the
form $xL^*z$ contain a prime or not.  One way of showing such families
do not contain a prime is to show that some prime $p$ nontrivially
divides every such number.  At first glance, this would require
checking that $p$ divides $xL^nz$ for $n=0$, $1$, $2$, $\dotsc$,
however the following lemma shows that it is only necessary to check
the cases $n=0$ and $1$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $p$ be a prime, let $x$, $z\in \Sigma^*_b$, and let $L\subseteq\Sigma^*_b$.
Then $p$ divides all numbers of the form $[xL^*z]_b$ if\/ 
$p$ divides $[xz]_b$ and all numbers of the form $[xLz]_b$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%Case 1. If $p\mid b$ then from $p\mid[xz]=[z_0]+b[xz_{n..1}]$ we have $p\mid[z_0]$,
%and thus for any $y\in L^*$ we have $p\mid[z_0]+b[xyz_{n..1}]=[xyz]$.
Let $y=y_n\dotsm y_1\in L^*$, where $y_1$, $\dotsc$, $y_n\in L$.  By telescoping we have
%\begin{align*}
%[xyz]_b &= [xz]_b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}([xy_{i}y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z]_b-[xy_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z]_b) \\
%&= [xz]_b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b^{\lvert{y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z}\rvert}([xy_i]_b-[x]_b) \\
%&= [xz]_b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b^{\vert{y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1}\rvert}([xy_iz]_b-[xz]_b)
%\end{align*}
\[ [xyz]_b - [xz]_b = \sum_{i=1}^{n}([xy_{i}y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z]_b-[xy_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z]_b) . \]
Cancelling the final base-$b$ digits in the summand difference which are identical, this becomes
\[ [xyz]_b = [xz]_b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b^{\lvert{y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1 z}\rvert}([xy_i]_b-[x]_b) . \]
But $b^{\lvert z\rvert}([xy_i]_b-[x]_b)=[xy_iz]_b-[xz]_b$ by adding and subtracting $[z]_b$, so we have
\[ [xyz]_b = [xz]_b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b^{\vert{y_{i-1}\dotsm y_1}\rvert}([xy_iz]_b-[xz]_b) . \]
Since $p\mid[xz]_b$ and $p\mid[xy_iz]_b$ for each $1\leq i\leq n$, it follows that $p\mid[xyz]_b$.
\end{proof}

\section{Our heuristic algorithm}

\section{Results}
A summary of the results of our algorithm is presented in Figure~\ref{resultsfig}.
For each base $b$ between 2 and 16 the size and width of $M(L_b)$ is given.
For bases between 17 and 28 a lower bound on the size and width of $M(L_b)$ is given,
along with the number of families of the form $xy^*z$ for which no prime could be found,
nor could the family be ruled out as only containing composites.

The results assume that a number which has passed several Miller--Rabin
tests is in fact prime, since in some cases (e.g., $b=13$) a candidate element of $M(L_b)$
is too long to be proven prime rigorously.

\section{Some additional strategies}

\section{Composite numbers}

One can also consider the companion problem of determining the
minimal elements for the composite numbers
$\lbrace 4,6,8,9,10, 12, \ldots $.  
Here, in contrast with the primes, we have

\begin{theorem}
The following decision problem is recursively solvable:  given
a base $b$ and a DFA $M$ accepting a language $L \subseteq 
C_b$, does $M$ accept the base-$b$ representation of a composite 
number?
\end{theorem}

This follows immediately from

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $L$ is a regular language, accepted by a 
deterministic finite automaton $M$ of $n$ states.  Then
if $M$ accepts a composite number expressed in base $b$, it must
accept one whose base-$b$ representation has at most
$n(b^{2n} + 1)$ digits.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $L$ is finite, then the longest string accepted by $M$ has
at most $n-1$ digits, and $n-1 < n(b^{2n} + 1)$.

Otherwise $L$ is infinite.  Then $M$ accepts a string of length
$\ell$ with $n < \ell \leq 2n$ that can be pumped (as in the
pumping lemma.  That is, there exists $x \in L$ such that
$x = uvw$ with $|uv| \leq n$.  Then a classical proof of the
non-regularity of the prime numbers 
(e.g., \cite[Example 3.2, p.\ 57]{HU79})
shows that either $x$ is the representation of a composite 
number (in which case $|x| \leq 2n \leq n(b^{2n} + 1)$)
or $u v^p w$ is composite, where $p = [x]_b$.  
Our bound now follows.
\end{proof}

\section{Open problems}

To illustrate once more the difficult of computing $M(L)$, we recall
an open problem from \cite{Sh00}:

\begin{problem} 
Let $L = \lbrace {\tt 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, } \ldots \rbrace$, the
base-$10$ representation of the powers of $2$.  
Is it the case that
$$ M(L) = \lbrace 1, 2, 4, 8, 65536 \rbrace ? $$
\end{problem}

This would follow, for example, if we could prove that every power
of $16$ greater than $65536$ contained at least one of the digits
$\lbrace 1,2,4, 8 \rbrace$.  But this seems beyond current capabilities.
