The srsieve-x86_64-windows.exe executable was built with an experimental
version of the GCC compiler known to produce bad code in some situations.

If you encounter problems, or just don't want to take the risk, then please
use the srsieve-x86-windows.exe executable instead.

Bug reports are still welcome, send details to Geoffrey Reynolds
<g_w_reynolds@yahoo.co.nz>.

Since srsieve is usually only used to create an initial sieve file for
further sieving with sr1sieve or sr2sieve, not much time is lost by using
the 32-bit version.

(Although built with the same compiler, the sr1sieve-x86_64-windows.exe and
sr2sieve-x86_64-windows.exe executables have been more thoroughly tested and
contain work-arounds for the compiler problems discovered as a result).
