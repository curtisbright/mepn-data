1. Edit the Makefile.
   In most cases it should suffice to set three variables: DEBUG; ASSEMBLER;
   ARCH.

2. Run 'make'
   This should produce two executables: srsieve; srfile.

3. Run 'make check' (GMP libraries required)
   This will run a series of self tests. If all is well then the message
   'All tests passed' will appear.
