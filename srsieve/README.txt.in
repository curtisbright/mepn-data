This directory contains source code and some binaries for the srsieve
program, a 'fixed k' sieve for sequences of the form k*b^n+c where k < 2^64,
b < 2^32, |c| < 2^63.


The latest version is VERSION.


For more specialised sieves see:

../sr1sieve/    Single sequence k*b^n+/-1
../sr2sieve/    Multiple sequences k*b^n+/-1 and b^n+/-k
